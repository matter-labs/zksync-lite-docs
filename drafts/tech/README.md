## What risks are involved?

No software can be guaranteed to be 100% error-free. Blockchain is still an experimental technology with rapidly evolving attack vectors. While Matter Labs is undertaking maximum possible efforts to protect your funds (including security audit and following established security practices), it is our duty to inform the users of zkSync of the potential risks of using any new crypto technology:

- There can be a bug in the smart contracts.
- There can be a bug in zero-knowledge circuits.
- Trusted setup could be compromised.
- New theoretical and breaches in the cryptography applied can be discovered.
- Finally, your wallet can be hacked.

We encourage you take your security seriously, but also account for potential failures. Use zkSync at your own risk and do not put more money into it than you can afford to lose.
