# User guide

(to discuss after you have tried goerli yourself)

## Getting started with zkSync UI

- zksync.io (goerli for testnet)
- non-custodial, web-based UI to interact with zkSync
- it doesn't store your private keys -- they are ephemerially recreated from a signature from your Ethereum wallet

## What wallets are supported

- metamask (+ledger etc.)
- wallet connect: list...
- fortmatic, ports, etc.
- we support both keypair- and smart-contract-based account (e.g. Argent)

## What is my zkSync address

Same as Ethereum address.

## How do I get tokens into zkSync

Two ways:

- either ask someone to money to your ethereum address
- or deposit from your wallet: link to client

## How do I make a transfer

- explain, link
- you'll need to sign a message -- explain why, link to security section

## Who can I send tokens to

Anybody with an Ethereum account -- see the list of supported wallets. They will be able to immediately send funds inside zkSync or just withdraw tokens to mainnet.

## Do I need to own ETH to pay gas

No, you pay in the tokens being transferred.

## How do I withdraw from zkSync

- explain, link

## Is there a block explorer

- explorer.zksync.io

## I have a different question
