## Add Funds to zkSync with MetaMask

In this tutorial, we will be depositing into a zkSync wallet with MetaMask on the Rinkeby test network. 
> While the tutorial shows the steps for Rinkeby, you can follow the same steps for mainnet.

To switch your network to Rinkeby on MetaMask, click on the "Ethereum Mainnet" button at the top of Metamask, and then select "Rinkeby." To get ETH on the Rinkeby testnet, visit the [faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/).

</br>  

1. Go to [https://wallet.zksync.io/](https://wallet.zksync.io/) and connect your wallet.
- To connect to the Rinkeby test network:
  - Click on the Ethereum symbol at the bottom right.
  - Select Rinkeby.

</p>
</br>

3. Select your token, enter the amount, and add funds.
- *If you can’t find your token:*
  - Some tokens will be referred to by their internal id number on our [Tokens page](https://zkscan.io/explorer/tokens/) instead of their token symbol. (E.g. on Rinkeby, ERC20-21 = UNI).
  - Add new token to zkSync:  
      1. Click "Can't find a token?"
      2. Use the link to access the [Tokens page](https://zkscan.io/explorer/tokens/). 
      3. Click "Add New Token" at the top right corner and follow the directions.

</br>

4. Review the transaction information and confirm.
</br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matter-labs/zksync-docs/master/docs/images/D5.png">
</p>
</br>

5. This is an L1 transaction (as you deposit funds from L1 to L2), and therefore the time for it to appear in a block depends on the fee that you set. Your funds will appear on L2 only after your transaction is processed on L1. If you have any difficulties, please check [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) to monitor the transaction. 
</br>

</p>
</br>

6. Your deposit is complete. The transaction has been initiated, and your funds will be visible in your zkSync wallet within ten confirmations of your L1 transaction.

## Account Activation
Your first transaction after depositing or funding your account requires a separate action for account activation. For more information about account activation, see [Account Activation FAQ](./faq.md#what-is-the-account-activation-fee).
1. You will be prompted to "Authorize to Sign account activation" and will need to sign the message first to generate your zkSync L2 private key.

</br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matter-labs/zksync-docs/master/docs/images/S3.png">
</p>

2. Then, you will be asked to sign the message for account activation (it is good practice to read the messages you sign).

## Send Funds on zkSync

In this tutorial, we’ll review how to transfer funds to another zkSync account. 
Whether an Ethereum user has a zkSync account or not, you can send them funds on zkSync to the same address they have on Ethereum. 

**Keep in mind these funds will be on Layer 2 (L2), so if you want to use these funds on Layer 1 (L1), you will have to [Send to Ethereum](#Send-funds-to-Ethereum).**


1. Go to "Send."
</br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matter-labs/zksync-docs/master/docs/images/S1.png">
</p>
</br>

> **If this is your first transaction after depositing or funding your zkSync account, see the [Account Activation](#account-activation) section.**

> **If you refreshed the page or recently connected your wallet to zkSync, you will be asked to "Authorize to Send on zkSync."**
> - Signing the message will re-generate your zkSync Layer 2 (L2) private key (remember, it is good practice to read the messages you sign).
</br>

2. Enter the address to send funds to, select the token to transfer, and enter the amount. 
- *Before transacting, you can change the fee token.*  
Users can pay transaction fees in all popular tokens since zkSync supports "gasless meta-transactions."
</br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matter-labs/zksync-docs/master/docs/images/S8.1.png">
</p>
</br>

3. Signing this message submits the transaction to the zkSync network. (remember, it is good practice to read the messages you sign).
</br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matter-labs/zksync-docs/master/docs/images/S7.png">
</p>
</br>

4. The transfer should take no longer than a couple of seconds. If you have any difficulties, please check [zkScan](https://zkscan.io/) to monitor the transaction. 
</br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matter-labs/zksync-docs/master/docs/images/S9.png">
</p>
</br>

5. Your transfer is complete! The transaction has been initiated and the funds are ready for immediate use.

## Send Funds to Ethereum

This tutorial will cover the process of withdrawing funds from zkSync back to the Ethereum main chain.
</br>

**Moving funds to an exchange**: If you want to move your funds from zkSync to an exchange, these steps follow the **correct method**.
*Alternatively, you can take a risk and enter the exchange address when you withdraw, but most exchanges do not observe smart contract transfers, which may require you to contact their customer support to see your funds on the exchange.*

1. Go to "Send." 
</br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matter-labs/zksync-docs/master/docs/images/se1.png">
</p>
</br>

2. Click on "Send to Ethereum (L1)."
</br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matter-labs/zksync-docs/master/docs/images/se2.png">
</p>
</br>

3. Your address will auto-populate with your address.  
**If you enter a different address for withdrawal, please check that it accepts smart contract transfers.**
</br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matter-labs/zksync-docs/master/docs/images/se.png">
</p>
</br>

> **If this is your first transaction after depositing or funding your zkSync account, see the [Account Activation](#account-activation) section.**

> **If you refreshed the page or recently connected your wallet to zkSync, you will be asked to "Authorize to Send to Ethereum."**
> - Signing the message will generate your zkSync Layer 2 (L2) private key (remember, it is good practice to read the messages you sign).
</br>

4. Select the token to send to Ethereum and enter the amount. 
- *Before transacting, you can change the fee token.*  
Users can pay transaction fees in all popular tokens since zkSync supports "gasless meta-transactions."
</br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matter-labs/zksync-docs/master/docs/images/se4.png">
</p>
</br>

> **Read the popup carefully to to prevent loss of funds.**
</br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matter-labs/zksync-docs/master/docs/images/se5.png">
</p>

5. Confirm the withdrawal amount, address, fee, and sign the message (remember, it is good practice to read the messages you sign).
</br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matter-labs/zksync-docs/master/docs/images/se6.png">
</p>
</br>

6. Your withdrawal has been initiated. There will be an immediate change in your account balance in zkSync, but **withdrawal times can take from 10 minutes to 7 hours before being available on L1.**
- *When network activity increases, blocks fill up faster, and withdrawal times decrease.*

## Mint an NFT

The following steps will cover using IPFS desktop to mint an NFT. This process will mint an NFT of where your image location on IPFS and will not be available for preview at this time. 
To mint an NFT with an IPFS location and a preview of the image, consider using one of the community-created frontends&ast; like [zkNFT](https://zknft.xyz/#/) or [Open Sky](https://open-sky.vercel.app/). 
</br>

*&ast;The community-created frontends are not created by the zkSync team, and any issues with minting will need to be sent to the creators of these frontends.*

1. Visit the [IPFS.io](https://ipfs.io/) and install IPFS Desktop.
</br>
<p align="center">

> **If you refreshed the page or recently connected your wallet to zkSync, you will be asked to "Authorize to Mint NFT."**
> - Signing the message will generate your zkSync Layer 2 private key (remember, it is good practice to read the messages you sign).
</br>

5. Enter the copied CID (Content Identifier) in "Content Address" and click "Mint NFT."
- *Before minting, you can change the fee token.*  
Users can pay transaction fees in all popular tokens since zkSync supports “gasless meta-transactions.”

</br>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matter-labs/zksync-docs/master/docs/images/m8.png">
</p>
</br>

7. Minting your NFT has been initiated and will be available for transfer, or withdrawal to L1, once it has been verified, which takes between 10 minutes to 7 hours.
- *When network activity increases, blocks fill up faster, and verification times decrease.*

## Alternative Withdrawal

The Alternative Withdrawal tool is used when funds have been sent to an account that cannot connect to the [zkSync wallet](https://wallet.zksync.io/). 

1. Check to see if your account qualifies to use the Alternative Withdrawal tool by entering your address on [zkScan](https://zkscan.io/).

2. Check your account for the following information:
- 1. The account is at least 24 hours old.
- 2. The account has never been activated (i.e., nonce is zero).
<br>
<p align="center">
