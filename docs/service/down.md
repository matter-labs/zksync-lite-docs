# zkSync <sub>BETA</sub> is temporarily unavailable

<br>
<br>
<br>

zkSync is temporarily down or undergoing a planned maintenance. We apologize for the inconvenience — our team is on it, we'll be back up in a bit!

While keeping 100% zkSync uptime can be challenging at this stage, **the security of users' assets is not affected at all by any operational issues**. A great thing about ZK rollup — the tech that powers zkSync — is that the funds are [secured purely by smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs](https://zksync.io/faq/security.html). The zkSync [protocol](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync/blob/master/docs/protocol.md) guarantees that any assets deposited into it will always be retrievable on Ethereum, even if all zkSync operators were shut down permanently or became malicious. Both smart contract and zero-knowledge parts of zkSync have been [thoroughly audited](https://zksync.io/zksync-1.0-audit.pdf).

You can monitor the operational status of all zkSync components and testnets at the [zkSync status page](https://uptime.com/s/zksync). Feel free to [contact us](https://zksync.io/contact.html) if you have any further questions.

Sincerely,

Your Matter Labs Team
