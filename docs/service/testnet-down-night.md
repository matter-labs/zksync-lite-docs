# zkSync on this testnet is temporarily unavailable

<br>
<br>
<br>

We apologize for the inconvenience — our team has been notified and will take care of this ASAP. Normally, we are
responding to testnet incidents almost instantly between 6am and 10pm CET. In the future, this availability window will
be extended to 24/7.

While keeping 100% zkSync uptime can be challenging at this stage, **the security of users' assets is not affected at
all by any operational issues**. A great thing about ZK rollup — the tech that powers zkSync — is that the funds are
[secured purely by smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs](/userdocs/security.md). The zkSync
[protocol](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync/blob/master/docs/protocol.md) guarantees that any assets deposited into
it will always be retrievable on Ethereum, even if all zkSync operators were shut down permanently or became malicious.
Both smart contract and zero-knowledge parts of zkSync have been [thoroughly audited](/updates/security-audits.md).

You can monitor the operational status of all zkSync components and testnets at the
[zkSync status page](https://uptime.com/s/zksync). Feel free to [contact us](https://docs.zksync.io/contact.html) if you have
any further questions.

Sincerely,

Your Matter Labs Team
