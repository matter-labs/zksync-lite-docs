# Welcome to zkSync

**zkSync** is a user-centric zk rollup platform from [Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io). It is a scaling solution for
Ethereum, already live on Ethereum mainnet.

<b>Some of the main features of zkSync are:</b>

- Extremely low transaction fees
- Trustless protocol
- Funds are cryptographically secure, as in the Ethereum mainnet
- Users are always in control of their funds
- No requirement for operational activity to keep the funds safe
