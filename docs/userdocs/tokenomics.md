# Tokenomics

[[toc]]

## Will zkSync have a native token?

Yes.

## When? How can I get the token?

Our efforts and focus have been so far dedicated for the development of zkSync and its security. Any announcements from
zkSync can be found on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/px2aR7w), [Telegram](https://t.me/zksync), and
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/zksync).

## How will it work?

When zkSync becomes [fully decentralized](/userdocs/decentralization.md#how-decentralized-is-zksync), the token will be
used for staking in order to become a validator in the zkSync network. More details to come.
