# Status page

To users that everything is working fine or that there are problems with a particular
subsystem, we use status page.

In total, 4 systems are checked for each of the networks (Mainnet, Goerli):

- Explorer
- REST API
- JSON RPC API
- Wallet

We use [uptime](https://uptime.com/s/zkSync) for status page and checking requests for each service.
