# Our Mission

A quote from our CEO and Co-Founder Alex Gluchowski from a recent [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/q8q822/ama_were_matter_labs_the_team_behind_zksync_the/):

> The vision for zkSync is firmly rooted in the ethos and philosophy of the early crypto movement. It's based on ideas of the cypherpunks, The Sovereign Individual, Satoshi, Vitalik, etc. In a 
> nutshell: we cherish freedom and the powerful new form of resilience arising from cryptography. You see, **cryptography is the only technology** available to any individual today that **enables defence against even the most powerful adversaries** (like a mighty totalitarian regime).

Cryptography is the most important tech protecting the world's freedom today — because it's the only technology that enables a single individual to resist immensely powerful adversaries. It led to the creation of public permissionless blockchains and is making radical financial sovereignty available for practically anyone in the world, for the first time in history.

Matter Labs/zkSync has a special role in the crypto movement. Our mission is:

> To accelerate the mass adoption of crypto for financial sovereignty.

## Decentralized, on principle

zkSync is a mission-driven project. Its purpose is to break financial barriers and enhance world’s freedom — by accelerating the mass adoption of public blockchains. We take this mission to heart: check out our public [Team Handbook](https://matterlabs.notion.site/matterlabs/Matter-Labs-Team-Handbook-43342b471fe14f05b2baf250cb7c7a02)

While healthy pragmatism is necessary to move fast, zkSync will never betray the ethos of crypto. Over the past two years, we’ve [fought relentlessly](https://medium.com/matter-labs/rollup-at-zcon1-74b6ea694ee6) to make sure that the widely adopted L2 is as secure, open, and reliable as Ethereum itself. We won’t rest until the original [zkSync vision](https://medium.com/matter-labs/introducing-zk-sync-the-missing-link-to-mass-adoption-of-ethereum-14c9cea83f58) is fully materialized. 

## Our Values 

### Fairness
The rules of the game must be equal for all, with no preferences to the wealthy or powerful. zkSync reinforces this by making Ethereum affordable.

### Inclusion
Free access to finance is a fundamental right. zkSync is unconditionally permissionless from day one, and will also bring strong censorship-resistance to L2.

### Resilience
We believe that only the paranoid survive. To resist even the most powerful potential adversaries, zkSync is going down the path of [progressive decentralization](https://zksync.io/faq/decentralization.html)
