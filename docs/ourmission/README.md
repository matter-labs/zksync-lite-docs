# Our Mission and Values

A quote from our CEO and Co-Founder Alex Gluchowski from a recent [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/q8q822/ama_were_matter_labs_the_team_behind_zksync_the/):

> The vision for zkSync is firmly rooted in the ethos and philosophy of the early crypto movement. It's based on ideas of the cypherpunks, The Sovereign Individual, Satoshi, Vitalik, etc. In a 
> nutshell: we cherish freedom and the powerful new form of resilience arising from cryptography. You see, **cryptography is the only technology** available to any individual today that **enables defence against even the most powerful adversaries** (like a mighty totalitarian regime).

Cryptography is the most important tech protecting the world's freedom today — because it's the only technology that enables a single individual to resist immensely powerful adversaries. It led to the creation of public permissionless blockchains and is making radical financial sovereignty available for practically anyone in the world, for the first time in history.

Matter Labs/zkSync has a special role in the crypto movement. Our mission is:

> To accelerate the mass adoption of crypto for financial sovereignty.

## Decentralized, on principle

zkSync is a mission-driven project. Its purpose is to break financial barriers and enhance world’s freedom — by accelerating the mass adoption of public blockchains. We take this mission to heart: check out our public [Team Handbook](https://matterlabs.notion.site/matterlabs/Matter-Labs-Team-Handbook-43342b471fe14f05b2baf250cb7c7a02)

While healthy pragmatism is necessary to move fast, zkSync will never betray the ethos of crypto. Over the past two years, we’ve [fought relentlessly](https://medium.com/matter-labs/rollup-at-zcon1-74b6ea694ee6) to make sure that the widely adopted L2 is as secure, open, and reliable as Ethereum itself. We won’t rest until the original [zkSync vision](https://medium.com/matter-labs/introducing-zk-sync-the-missing-link-to-mass-adoption-of-ethereum-14c9cea83f58) is fully materialized. 

## Our Values 

### Fairness
The rules of the game must be equal for all, with no preferences to the wealthy or powerful. zkSync reinforces this by making Ethereum affordable.

### Inclusion
Free access to finance is a fundamental right. zkSync is unconditionally permissionless from day one, and will also bring strong censorship-resistance to L2.

### Resilience
We believe that only the paranoid survive. To resist even the most powerful potential adversaries, zkSync is going down the path of [progressive decentralization](https://zksync.io/faq/decentralization.html)

## Freedom and Founding Matter Labs

Our founder Alex Gluchowski on the founding of Matter Labs and freedom: 
>Alex V. and I (Alex G.) founded Matter Labs because we love freedom: the ability to do what you want and not to do what you hate.

>We wanted to be in the flow, tackling exciting technological problems on the edge of the complexity that our minds can handle — and experience the joy of accomplishment when the fruits of our work materialize. We hated bureaucracy with its stupid rules and limitations that are so often imposed by clueless people in the position of power.

>This is something we want to share with you. We're doing our best to assemble a team of talented people who are self-motivated, love what they are doing, and enjoy the highest degree of autonomy.

>But it's not just something that guides our work — it is its end goal. I'm convinced that **the single most impactful thing you can do today to make this world better is to increase people’s freedom**. More freedom is key to eliminating poverty, to the equality of opportunities, to more wealth for everyone, more fun and creativity, faster scientific and technological progress, less injustice and suffering through corruption and oppression.
